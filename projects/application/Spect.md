## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
Spect is the first web3 freelancing platform that is being designed to make fully trustless and customizable deals between two parties - the freelancers and the client. 

Spect aims to reduce the barrier to entry for newcomers to find work in web3. On Spect, it will be possible for anyone from any field of expertise to showcase their expertise and work on web3 projects from the day they setup a web3 wallet. It will also be possible for web3 projects and startups to hire talent from a global talent pool. 

Our long term objective is to create a fully decentralized solution that will empower freelancers to make a higher income while doing the work that they love and clients to pay minimal platform fees to get work done.
